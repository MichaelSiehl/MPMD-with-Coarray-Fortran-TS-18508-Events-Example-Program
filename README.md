# MPMD with Coarray Fortran TS-18508 Events Example Program

# Overview
OpenCoarrays/GFortran does already support TS-18508 Events (Fortran 2015), a fairly flexible one-sided synchronization mechanism.

This Repository contains a Fortran (2015) coarray example program that uses TS-18508 Events successfully with a MPMD-like setup. The example program was derived from our original 'MPMD with Fortran 2008 Coarrays' example program: https://github.com/MichaelSiehl/MPMD-with-Fortran-2008-Coarrays. Only few modifications were required to try out this new feature successfully (OpenCoarrays/GFortran only by now). For a brief description of the modifications see our short paper 'MPMD with Coarray Fortran: TS 18508 Events - Example Program' (pdf format) in the Repositorys main folder or at http://www.mpmd-with-coarray-fortran.de/TS18508_Events_example.pdf.

Most of the files herein were firstly published on the website www.mpmd-with-coarray-fortran.de.
